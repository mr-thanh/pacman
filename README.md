I build pacman automatically move on map randomly. Each step is one unit: up, down, left or right.
There are some things on the map:
- Pacman (@):
- Cherry (c): give pacman 1 life point and 5 points
- Banana (b): give pacman 2 points
- Ghost (g): when he meet a ghost, he is going to lose 1 life point. If his life point is less than 0, he die.
- Medal (M): The final goal. When he get Medal, he win the game.

Some picture of his:
